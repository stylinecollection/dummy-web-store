- API Keys/SDK Credentials are provided via email
- A test store is already configured and prepopulated with products and categories

##### Objectives (Basic)

- Each product item should show product name, product image (just one), sku, price, stock and category
- Products should be filtered by categories, stock availablability
- Products should be sorted by price
- Implement Customer Sign Up and Login functionalities using Moltin SDK (No email/sms verification is required)
- If the customer is logged in, show customer's name and logout button.
- Also an add to cart button should be visible with each products if customer is logged in (and if the product is in stock)

##### Objectives (Advanced)
- Show a Cart button when customer is logged in
- If Add to cart is pressed the product should be added to cart
- Tapping the cart button should take the user to a cart page where all items in the cart should be listed
- User should be able to remove items from cart and go back to the product page from the cart page

##### Notes
- UI can be very simple, but should be consistent
- Any UI Framework/icon sets/themes can be used
- You must use the provided backend (Moltin) using any of their SDKs or REST API and have to use the API/Access Keys that has been provided
- Focus should be on workable and consistent functionalities rather than aesthetics
